defmodule ExBdd.PendingSkippedTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Behaviour tests for pending and skipped step results (#21), driven by the
  vendored CCK `pending`, `skipped`, `hooks-skipped`, `skipped-failing-hook`,
  and `all-statuses` samples plus inline features for the Elixir-specific
  surface (`{:pending, message}` / `{:skipped, reason}`, backgrounds,
  before-hook signals).

  Scenarios within one generated module run in seed order, so multi-scenario
  fixtures are asserted via event counts and membership rather than strict
  cross-scenario ordering.
