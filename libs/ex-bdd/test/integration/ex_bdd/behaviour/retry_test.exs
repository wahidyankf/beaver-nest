defmodule ExBdd.RetryTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Behaviour tests for retry (#26), driven by the vendored CCK `retry`,
  `retry-undefined`, `retry-ambiguous`, and `retry-pending` samples plus
  inline features for the Elixir-specific surface (`@retry-n` tags, fresh
  context per attempt, hook re-runs).

  The CCK runs its retry samples with `--retry 2`; the equivalent here is
  `config :ex_bdd, retry: 2`, set per test via `with_retry_config/2`.
  Attempt counting uses the Collector: a step counts its own prior events
  to decide whether to fail, mirroring the reference step definitions'
  module-level counters.
