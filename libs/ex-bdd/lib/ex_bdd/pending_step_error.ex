defmodule ExBdd.PendingStepError do
  @moduledoc """
  Exception raised when a step (or before hook) signals it is not yet
  implemented by returning `:pending` or `{:pending, message}`.

  Pending follows the ExBdd semantics: the remaining steps in the
  scenario are skipped, after hooks still run, and the scenario as a whole
  fails with this error — pending work is a failure, unlike `:skipped`
  which is deliberate and non-failing.

  This is a distinct exception type (rather than a `ExBdd.StepError`) so
  downstream features can treat it specially — e.g. retry logic must never
  retry a pending step, and ExBdd Messages report it as PENDING rather
  than FAILED.
