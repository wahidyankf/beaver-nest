description: 'Link workspace packages in monorepos (npm, yarn, pnpm, bun). USE WHEN: (1) you just created or generated new packages and need to wire up their dependencies, (2) user imports from a sibling package and needs to add it as a dependency, (3) you get resolution errors for workspace packages (@org/*) like "cannot find module", "failed to resolve import", "TS2307", or "cannot resolve". DO NOT patch around with tsconfig paths or manual package.json edits - use the package manager''s workspace commands to fix actual linking.'
